    Review & Update Me

The development of
the Photovoltaic Geographic Information System (PVGIS) 6
owes much to the collaboration and generosity of several key individuals.
Beside the support from the PVGIS Team itself
and staff of the Renewable Energies Unit,
expert insights on a voluntary basis
enhanced significantly the project's scope and impact.

Gratitude to the following contributors:

## Special Recognition

**EuroHPC**

For granting access to the
[MeluXina](https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index_en) supercomputer
in which the first experiments of
fine-chunked in-space & contiguous in-time large time series
were performed.

**Joerg Trentmann** & **Uwe Pfeifroth** (DWD)

For thoroughly reviewing and discussing together
early versions of the source code for fundamental functions in solar irradiance,
and invaluable support
on working with solar irradiance time series from the SARAHx climate records.

**Sepand Kashani** (previously EPFL | core developer in [pyxu](https://pyxu-org.github.io/))

For early discussions and guidance
in shaping a modern high-performance Python-based software architecture
that set the technical foundation for PVGIS 6.

**Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas** (ETH Zürich)

For early problem-solving insights
around high-performance computing with Python
and optimization strategies.

**Gregor Trefalt** & **Richard Hochenberger**

For assistance in selecting the right software stack
and basic concepts behind data model structures in Python.

**Panagiotis Mavrogiorgos**

For setting the first seeds for an Open-Source version of PVGIS with the
development of internal Python-based tooling for PVGIS version 5.

**Ruben Urraca** (JRC)

For his exceptional contributions
to better understand both theoretical and practical aspects of solar science,
critical reviews, and discussions shaping the performance analysis workflow
and ensuring scientific rigor.

**Blago Mihaylov** & **Diego Pavanello** (JRC)

For support in better understanding and implementing functions for the spectral
mismatch effect.

**Martin Durant** ([Dask](https://pyxu-org.github.io/), [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))  
**Adam Jensen** & **Kevin Anderson** ([pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))

For their invaluable time contributig to a _developers meeting_
suggesting problem-solving ideas.
