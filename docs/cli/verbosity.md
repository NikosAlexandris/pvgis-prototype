## Verbosity :material-details:

!!! danger

    Explain -v -vv -vvv -vvvv .. up to -vvvvvvvv

### Debugging :material-bug:

    Using `-vvvvvvvv` in (almost!) every command, will print the complete set
    of local variables relevant to the API function called from the invoked
    command line tool.
