# Welcome

Welcome yourself in the PVGIS command line interface (CLI) 

``` bash exec="true" result="ansi" source="above"
pvgis-prototype
```

!!! hint

    Running any command _without_ arguments,
    will display the help overview,
    just as when runnning them with the `--help` parameter.

!!! tip "Auto-completion in the command line"

    Auto-completion in the command line can be installed optionally.
    This is offered via the _hidden_ command `completion` :

    ``` bash exec="true" result="ansi" source="above"
    pvgis-prototype completion show --help
    ```
