With PVGIS,
you can calculate individual solar irradiance components at will. Almost!
While effort has been put to set sane default values for optional parameters,
there are many parameters at your fingertips.

We can see the list of available subcommands for `irradiance` by running

``` bash exec="true" result="ansi" source="above"
pvgis-prototype irradiance
```
