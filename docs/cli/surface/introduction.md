Solar ==surface== in the context of PVGIS
refers to a _photovoltaic_ surface
capable to capture incident solar irradiance
and generate electricity.

The amount of solar irradiance incident on a solar surface
at a location and a moment in time,
depends primarily on the Solar Incidence angle.
PVGIS can estimate over a period of time
the optimal placement of a solar surface
that maximises the very incidence angle
and hence the overall photovoltaic power output.

`#!bash pvgis-prototype surface`
is a small collection of tools
related to _solar_, i.e. _photovoltaic_ surfaces.

The most interesting one is
`#!bash pvgis-prototype surface optimise`
which estimates the optimal position of a _photovoltaic_ surface
that will maximise the photovoltaic power output.
