Photovoltaic power
is the electrical energy generated by a photovoltaic (PV) system
when solar irradiance strikes its surface
and is converted into electricity.
This process relies on the photovoltaic effect,
where solar cells transform sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity,
which can then be used immediately, stored,
or fed into the electrical grid.
The power output of a PV system
depends on multiple factors such as
the angle of sunlight incidence,
the efficiency of the solar panels,
environmental conditions,
and the amount of solar irradiance available.

PVGIS
estimates photovoltaic power output
for various technologies
using either broadband or _spectrally resolved irradiance data_ (the latter not implemnted!).
A crucial metric for evaluating PV system performance
is the cumulative energy produced over a given time period
-- daily, monthly, or annually --
which aggregates instantaneous power outputs over that timeframe.

PVGIS calculates power output in two key phases.
First,
it determines the sun’s position relative to the solar surface during the selected period,
focusing on the solar incidence angle,
which depends on solar altitude and azimuth angles
combined with the panel’s location, orientation, and tilt.
PVGIS follows the *North-Up = 0°* convention
for azimuth angular measurements,
an important consideration in solar positioning
and incidence angle calculations.

Second,
based on the incidence angle,
PVGIS estimates the direct, diffuse, and ground-reflected irradiance components
reaching the panel surface.
It then integrates environmental inputs like
ambient temperature and wind speed
to derive conversion efficiency coefficients
that reflect the PV panel’s ability to convert irradiance into electrical power.

The algorithm includes :

1. Define an arbitrary period of time

2. Calculate the ==solar altitude== angle series

3. Calculate the ==solar azimuth== angle series

4. Derive masks for the position of the sun in the horizon

5. Calculate the ==direct horizontal irradiance== component

6. Calculate the diffuse ==sky-reflected== and ==ground-reflected== irradiance components

7. Sum the individual irradiance components

8. Read time series of ambient ==temperature== and ==wind speed== conditions

9. Derive the photovoltaic conversion ==efficiency coefficients==

10. Estimate the ==photovoltaic power== output

This approach enables PVGIS to provide accurate,
time-resolved estimations of photovoltaic power outputs
tailored to user-defined conditions and surface orientations.
