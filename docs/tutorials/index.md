This section features a structured series of tutorials
that will introduce you to elements of photovoltaic performance
throught PVGIS' command line tools.
Or, vice versa,
an introduction to the capabilities of PVGIS
through the basic theory of photovoltaic power output.

Each section is a stand-alone tutorial
and altogether they form a theoretical walk-through
via hands-on practical examples.
