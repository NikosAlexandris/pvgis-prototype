This structured tutorial series
introduces you to the concepts of photovoltaic performance
through the PVGIS command line tools. 

Whether you're exploring
the capabilities of PVGIS
through hands-on command examples
or studying the basics of photovoltaic power,
each tutorial stands alone
yet fits together into a cohesive theoretical walk-through.
