# Adding New Features in PVGIS' API

If you know your ways around Python,
it should be not difficult to add a new feature
(i.e. an algorithm or some helper function)
in PVGIS' API.

Given a working implementation of a function of interest in Python,
the steps to integrate it in PVGIS' API are:

1. add the function as a Python module under the `algorithms` directory
2. add a new function under the `api` directory
