# Help ?

For each and every command, there is a `--help` option.
Please consult it to grasp the details for
a command,
its arguments and optional parameters,
default values
and settings that can further shape the output.

For example,

``` bash exec="0"
pvgis-prototype
```

or

``` bash exec="true" result="ansi" source="above"
pvgis-prototype --help
```
