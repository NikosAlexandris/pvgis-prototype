    This documentation is auto-generated and regularly updated
    to reflect the latest development changes.

Welcome to the documentation of
the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS).

The content is designed to help you navigate through the features,
capabilities, and detailed references of PVGIS' Web API, CLI or even its core
API.

!!! warning

    The Web API is not the same at the core API. The former consumes the latter
    to produce a FastAPI-based Web API interface.

## What is PVGIS ?

[PVGIS][PVGIS]
is an open web tool of the European Commission
developed and maintained by
the Energy Efficiency and Renewables Unit (Ispra) of the Energy,
Transport and Climate directorate.

For over two decades,
the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)
has maintained the [web application PVGIS][PVGIS Web Application].

### Features & Capabilities

**Photovoltaic performance**

PVGIS
offers public service insights on solar radiation and photovoltaic performance,
providing location-specific estimates of power output
for systems using various PV (Photo Voltaic) technologies.

**TMY**

Additionally,
it can generate Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) datasets,
commonly used in energy efficiency studies for buildings.
Its capabilities,
combined with its cost-free accessibility,
have made it popular within the solar and photovoltaic community,
attracting professionals, students, and interested citizens alike.

**Significance**

A testament to PVGIS’ significance
is the usage of its public Web API (Application Programming Interface) service,
which receives weekly over 50,000 unique requests.

In overview :

- **Feature 1**: [Short description of feature]
- **Feature 2**: [Short description of feature]
- **Feature 3**: [Short description of feature]
- [And so on...]

For a full list of features, see the [Features](features.md) page.
