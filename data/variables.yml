- lemma: Declination
  lemma_name: declination_angle
  symbol: δ
  definition: The solar declination is the angle between the rays of the sun and the equator of the earth.
  description: The solar declination angle is used along with its right ascension the solar azimuth and the true solar elevation angles. Further, the solar azimuth and elevation angles can be corrected for refraction to give its apparent position.

- lemma: Hour angle
  lemma_name: hour_angle

- lemma: Refraction
  lemma_name: apply_atmospheric_refraction
  symbol:
  definition: Atmospheric refraction is the deviation of light from a straight line as it passes through the atmosphere due to the variation in air density as a function of height.
  description: In the context of solar position, the basic calculation of the solar declination angle and successively the solar zenith and elevation angles, do not include the effects of atmospheric refraction. Atmospheric refraction causes the apparent angle of elevation of the Sun, as seen by an observer, to be higher than the actual angle of elevation, especially at low Sun elevations. For example, when the Sun is at an elevation of 10°, it appears to be at 10.1°.
