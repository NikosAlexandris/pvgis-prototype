require:
  # Due to the recursive nature of the data model definition factory
  # that tranforms nested YAML relationships in to Python definitions,
  # and in order to achieve proper order of "columns" in the output table
  # for a Clear-Sky Direct Irradiance data model,
  # we need to _require_ first the "Core" output structure for it.
  # Otherwise, the main value of this data model,
  # namely the time series of direct inclined irradiance,
  # will not appear as the first column in the output table
  # when requested from an `irradiance direct inclined` command.

  # Core section -- This must come first !
  - irradiance/direct/output/element/inclined/direct_inclined_irradiance

  - irradiance/direct/output/template/inclined

  # Atmospheric properties
  - atmosphere/output/element/linke_turbidity_factor
