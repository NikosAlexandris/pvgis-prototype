    type: str
    initial: "A solar irradiance component such as global, direct, diffuse, reflected or extraterrestrial and any of normal, horizontal or inclined, is a solar power component received per unit area at a given moment, expressed in watts per square meter (W/m²). Except for the extraterrestrial and direct normal components, the values concern a specicif location and a moment or period in time."
