description: Output structure element for the clear-sky diffuse ground-reflected irradiance on an inclined surface.
note: The clear-sky (or simulated) diffuse ground-reflected irradiance on an inclined surface component requires the simulated direct and diffuse sky-reflected horizontal irradiance components.  In contrast, and obviously, the other data model (all-sky) based on external time series of global horizontal irradiance does not need the former ones to calculate itself!
