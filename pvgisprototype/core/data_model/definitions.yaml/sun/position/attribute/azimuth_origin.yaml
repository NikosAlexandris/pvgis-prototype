description: Attribute for the solar azimuth origin of a solar position/ing data model
notes: Important to understand for this attribute is its purpose to serve comand like the `position overview` and not the `position azimuth` itself.  The `origin` in a SolarAzimuth object obviously refers to its origin (i.e. Norh ot East).  The `overview` command, however, packs more quantities in one data model together. Hence it is necessary to clarify this through the name of the attribute itself, i.e. `azimuth_origin` !
