name: ReflectivityCoefficientAttribute
label: Reflectivity Coefficient
type: Attribute
description: Attribute for a surface reflectivity coefficient, practically an incidence angle modifier.
note: The surface reflectivity coefficient differs from the surface reflectivity factor. It is rather specific to the diffuse sky-reflected inclined irradiance.
use: Use this attribute preferrably in a diffuse inclined irradiance component data model. The simple parameter name `reflectivity_coefficient` would for example fit well in the context of such a data model. It is always possible to override any field-value, like for example the title.
